# Landing-page
Hi! 
This is my second work with Odin Poject - Landing page.

I'm trying to use as much flexbox as my head can.

Hope you'll like it!

I think it looks messy, especially CSS and inheritance. 
But I will comeback in future, to tidy things up for shure!

Picture ownership goes to my dear friend - Martin Severa.
Drawings made by me in Paint, lol.
